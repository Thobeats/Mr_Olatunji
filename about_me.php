                            My Purpose is to see that people get to understand the value and the purpose 
                            of good relationships and marriage. That the world comes to the knowledge of the 
                            significance, purpose, and power of love. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Seeing that through genuine love, we can achieve joyful and lasting relationships and marriage.
                            We can also learn the art of forgiveness and letting go of every form of resentments, which leads to a life at liberty 
                            to live for God (to enjoy His communion and fellowship) and to live at peace with others especially our loved ones.
